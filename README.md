Development Plan:
1. Preparation

Setup project repository and environment.

Acquire necessary API keys (Twitter and weather service).

2. Integration with APIs

Integrate Twitter API using a library like Tweepy.

Integrate a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

3. Data Retrieval and Formatting

Fetch weather data for Istanbul.

Format tweet messages clearly.

4. Scheduling Tweets

Automate tweet posting at predefined times.

5. Deployment

Deploy to a cloud service or a scheduled task system (e.g., cron or GitHub Actions).

Step-by-step Development Tasks:
Task 1: Project Setup
Create GitHub repository.

Initialize Python environment (virtualenv or venv).

Install necessary libraries (requests, tweepy, python-dotenv).

Task 2: Obtain API Keys
Register on Twitter Developer Portal and create an app to get keys.

Register on OpenWeatherMap and get an API key.

Task 3: Configure API Access
Create .env file to store API credentials securely.

Write Python script to load environment variables.

Task 4: Fetch Weather Data
Write function to fetch data from weather API for Istanbul.

Test data retrieval using API key.

Task 5: Format Tweets
Write a function to format fetched data into readable tweets.

Example tweet:
"üå¶Ô∏è Istanbul Weather Update üå¶Ô∏è
Temperature: 20¬∞C, Condition: Cloudy
Wind: 15 km/h, Humidity: 75%."

Task 6: Twitter Integration
Set up Tweepy to authenticate and send tweets.

Test tweeting manually.

Task 7: Automation
Schedule the Python script to run four times daily (e.g., at 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, and 20:00).

Test the scheduled tweets locally or with GitHub Actions.

Task 8: Deployment
Deploy your script on a cloud hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS Lambda, or GitHub Actions cron job).

Task 9: Monitoring and Maintenance
Set up basic logging and error handling.

Monitor tweets daily for consistency.
